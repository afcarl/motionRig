# motionRig

A set of python tools for controlling a Welch Labs motion rig. If you have a Welch Labs motion rig, and your name isn't Stephen Welch, I have no idea how you got one. Perhaps you stole it. If you did steal it, 1) that's amazing, that thing is really hard to move, 2) please return it. 

# About this Repository
This repository contains a set of methods designed to control a 5-axis motion rig. I'm seeking here to create something that I can quickly use to get the shots I want. 

## To Do
- Figure out how to program a "keep looking at the same spot" mode - where I can move the u/d l/r f/b axes, and the pan tilt controllers do thier best to remain focused on a single point.

# Complete (ish)
- Wrap up my motor class and possible some other stuff into nice importable scripts.
- Create a couple ipython notebook example cases
- Write a "persistent memory" for my motor class - this will be super helpful!
